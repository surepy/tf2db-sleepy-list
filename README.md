# tf2db-sleepy-list
sleepy's us-west tf2bd list, marked while playing the game.  

I mispelled tf2bd, lol  

manually given "racist" tag is given to "oooh look at me im so edgy" people.  
if ur on the playerlist.sleepy.json and marked as a cheater I'm not removing you lmao  

suspicious marks and flat out errors i will correct.

## what do these files mean?

real human cheaters, or kind of suspicious players.

### playerlist.sleepy-no-proof.json
i don't know if the players in these are bots or real players; i forgot; marks should be accurate however

cheaters or possible cheaters that i found probably by just using discord, or just finding it
